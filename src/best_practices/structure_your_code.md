# Structure your code

Well organized code is very important for the maintainability of the project.

The goal is to best leverage Ballerina features to create clean, effective code. In practical terms, proper structure making clean code whose logic and dependencies are clear as well as how the files and folders are organized in the filesystem.

## The nomenclature 

**Single .bal file**
- Smallest unit of compilation in ballerina build system. 
- Can be used for simple applications and not recommended for larger applications.

**Package**
- Ballerina code is organized in a single shareable unit called a package.
- A package is a collection of modules.
- A package should contain at least one module called the default module.
- It is common in small projects to have only one (default) module in a package. As a result, the default moduleâ€™s content is placed directly in the root of the package director

**Module**
- Module is a collection of Ballerina source files, test files, and resources.  
- Each module has its own directory, which organizes source files, test files, and resources.

- Doing everything on a single .bal file without leveraging the Ballerina packages/modules.
- Having lots of unrelated components in the default module of the package, without breaking them into multiple modules.
- Lengthy `.bal` files without breaking the logic into meaningful files.
- Heavy usage of global state or context which is not needed.

**Project Structure**
- Decide on logical seperation of your components and structure the project with modules accordingly. 
- Depending on the complexity and usecase break the code into multiple `.bal` files. 

**Naming and versioning**
- Use proper `org` name and `package` name for your project in `Ballerina.toml` file.
- When choosing an organization name, consider the restrictions for the organization name of a package when publishing to Ballerina Central. Organization name can only contain alphanumeric values with lower case letters and cannot start with numeric values. 
- Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) when version the package.

**Documentation**
- Properly [document](https://ballerina.io/learn/generate-code-documentation/) public APIs, and fucntions exposed via the package.
- Add up-to-date and meaningful overview to package and modules in `Package.md` and `Module.md` files as that will give a great overview for the users of your package. 

**Configuration Management** 
- Configuration values containing passwords or secrets should not be passed with the normal configuration.
- Such sensitive data can be passed to runtime using a different TOML file, and we can prioritize it higher than the normal configuration by prefixing the file path in the BAL_CONFIG_FILES environment variable.
- Add `Config.toml` file into `.gitignore` to avoid accidential commits of sensitive configs.

**Dependency Management** 

- By default, the compiler always looks up the latest compatible versions of the dependencies in the repositories when building a package. However, if you need to achieve reproducible builds use offline and sticky modes. Using the `--offline` flag along with the `--sticky` flag will ensure a predictable build with optimal time for compilation. It will stick to the exact versions locked in the `Dependencies.toml`.
- When it is needed to package JAR files with the archives, maintain Java libraries inside the package. The platform-specific library information needs to be specified in the `Ballerina.toml` file.
