# Mappings

- A mapping value is a container where each member has a key, which is a string, that uniquely identifies within the mapping.
- We use the term field to mean the member together its key; the name of the field is the key, and the value of the field is that value of the member.
- No two fields in a mapping value can have the same name. 
- A mapping is iterable.
