# Introduction to Ballerina

## What is Ballerina?

- Ballerina is a general-purpose, open-source programming language.
- It specializes in solving integration/API integration/network interactions & cloud-based problems by providing the right level of language abstractions and tools.
- Ballerina is NOT a JVM language.
- Ballerina is a programming language which is 
    - compiled : (Compiled languages are converted directly into machine code that the processor can execute. C, C++, Rust, Go are examples. In interpreted Languages, interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command. PHP, Ruby, Python are examples.    )
    - type safe :
    - concurrent :
- Ballerina is neither an object oriented language nor a functional one.
    - While the language has objects, the development methods are not completely OOP-based.
    - Both objects and functions are first class concepts, giving developers the ability to choose the best option based on their requirements.   
- It has two implementations.
    - jBallerina - written in java to run on top of JVM. This is the first implementation to prove the language. 
    - nBallerina - Compiled using LLVM, directly to the platform architecture. 


## What are the unique features of Ballerina? 

- **Data-oriented** - Ballerina makes it easy for the user to transfer, declare, manipulate, process and query the data.
- **Network oriented** - Ballerina has language constructs/concepts which capture network primitives. (E.g., type system concepts to easily bind data coming via network to language types, service types, client types, etc.)
- **Graphical representation** - Can easily explain network interactions via sequence diagrams. Each program has both a textual syntax and an equivalent graphical form based on sequence diagrams
- **Enterprise-grade application development** - Built-in concurrency, Explicit error handling, transactions,  full life cycle management concepts including testing, documenting, configurability, dependency management & versioning
- **Cloud-Native** - Reduces the gap between development to deployment and makes it easier for the developer to write the application and instruct how it should be deployed in the cloud.
